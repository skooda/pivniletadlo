# Beer 🍺 multilevel marketing club
This is a Czech multilevel marketing concept, but it is intended to generate beers instead of money.

The rules is simple, every new member pays beer for all other members to join the club. We are aiming to find, how much beers the club will totaly order before the market will be fullfiled.

This is partly a social experiment and partly joke. 

🚫 It is not about promoting alcoholism and bad behaviour (but we are a Czech guys, beer is part of our country DNA, make it fun and don't be a Caren please)
